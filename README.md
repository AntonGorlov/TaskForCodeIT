# TaskForCodeIT


Use pure C language to solve the tasks:

1) Write a function which takes an input parameter number, and returns the sum of it's digits until the result has only one digit. E.g: 128 is like 1 + 2 + 8 = 11, 11 is like = 1 + 1 = 2. 2 Is one digit so it is correct.

2) Write function which take an input parameter array of integers. Remove duplicates in the most efficient way.

3) Write function which checks if parameter (number) is a power of three. Do it without usage of a loop or recursion.
